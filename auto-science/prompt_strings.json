You will be given a series of monthly average temperatures for some city and some year and asked to predict if the city is in North America or not. At the end, you will be asked to provide a hypothesis for the relationship between the monthly average temperatures and whether the city is in North America or not. The goal is the generate a hypothesis that you can reference in the future to improve your predictions.",
