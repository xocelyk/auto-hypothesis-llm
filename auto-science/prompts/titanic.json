Your job is to predict which passengers survived the Titanic shipwreck. After assessing your predictions, you will be asked to provide a hypothesis for the relationship between features in the Titanic passenger data and the likelihood of passenger survival. The goal is to generate a hypothesis that will be useful to a future agent performing the same prediction task.",
