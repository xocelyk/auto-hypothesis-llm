You will be given a series of monthly average temperatures for some city and some year and asked to predict if the city is in North America or not. After assessing your predictions, you will be asked to provide a hypothesis for the relationship between the monthly average temperatures and whether the city is in North America or not. The goal is to generate a hypothesis that will be useful to a future agent performing the same prediction task.",
