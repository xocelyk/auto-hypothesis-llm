Your job is to predict whether or not the median house value for households within a block is greater than $200,000. After assessing your predictions, you will be asked to provide a hypothesis between the features in the housing data and the median house value being greater than $200,000. The goal is to generate a hypothesis that will be useful to a future agent performing the same prediction task.",
