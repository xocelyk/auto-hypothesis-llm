If the median income of households in a block is greater than $38,273, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000. Otherwise, if the median income is less than or equal to $38,273, then the housing median age is the next important feature to consider. If the housing median age is less than or equal to 16 years, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000. Otherwise, if the housing median age is greater than 16 years, then the total rooms in the houses is the next important feature to consider. If the total rooms are greater than 1999, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000. Otherwise, if the total rooms are less than or equal to 1999, then the median house value for houses in this block is less than or equal to $200,000.<H>



<H>- If the median income of households in the block is greater than $35,000, then the median house value in the block is greater than $200,000. 
- If the median income of households in the block is less than or equal to $35,000 and the housing median age is less than or equal to 16 years, then the median house value in the block is greater than $200,000. 
- If the median income of households in the block is less than or equal to $35,000, the housing median age is greater than 16 years, and the total rooms in the block is greater than 1500, then the median house value in the block is greater than $200,000. 
- Otherwise, the median house value in the block is less than or equal to $200,000.

This hypothesis suggests that median income is the most important predictor of median house value in a block being greater than $200,000. If the median income is greater than $35,000, then the block is likely to have a median house value greater than $200,000. However, if the median income is less than or equal to $35,000, the housing median age and total rooms become important predictors. If the housing median age is less than or equal to 16 years, then the block is still likely to have a median house value greater than $200,000. If the housing median age is greater than 16 years, then the block is likely to have a median house value greater than $200,000 only if it has more than 1500 total rooms.<H>



<H>- If the median income of the households in a block is less than or equal to $38,000, then the median house value in that block is less than or equal to $200,000.
- If the median income of the households in a block is greater than $38,000, then:
  - If the housing median age is greater than 15 years, then the median house value in that block is greater than $200,000.
  - If the housing median age is less than or equal to 15 years, then:
    - If the total number of rooms is greater than 1,900, then the median house value in that block is greater than $200,000.
    - If the total number of rooms is less than or equal to 1,900, then the median house value in that block is less than or equal to $200,000.

This decision tree suggests that the median income of households is the most important predictor for median house value in a block being greater than $200,000. Blocks with a median income greater than $38,000 are likely to have a median house value greater than $200,000, but the level of housing development and age of the housing stock also contribute to this outcome.<H>



<H>If the median income of households in the block is greater than $50,000, then the median house value is likely to be greater than $200,000. However, if the median income is less than or equal to $50,000, then the number of rooms in the houses becomes an important factor. If the number of rooms in the houses is greater than 2800, then the median house value is likely to be greater than $200,000. Otherwise, if the number of rooms is less than or equal to 2800, then the age of the houses becomes important. If the age of the houses is less than or equal to 25 years, then the median house value is likely to be greater than $200,000. However, if the age of the houses is greater than 25 years, then the median house value is likely to be less than or equal to $200,000.<H>



<H>If the median income is greater than $70,000, then the median house value is likely to be greater than $200,000. If the median income is less than or equal to $70,000, then the age of the housing and the number of bedrooms become important factors in determining the median house value. If the housing median age is less than or equal to 20 years and the total number of bedrooms is greater than 200, then the median house value is likely to be greater than $200,000. Otherwise, if the housing median age is greater than 20 years and the total number of bedrooms is less than or equal to 200, then the median house value is likely to be less than or equal to $200,000.<H>



<H>If the median income of households in a block is greater than $38,273, then the median house value for houses in that block is likely to be greater than $200,000. 

If the median income of households in a block is less than or equal to $38,273 and the housing median age is less than or equal to 16, then the median house value for houses in that block is likely to be greater than $200,000.

If the median income of households in a block is less than or equal to $38,273, the housing median age is greater than 16, and the total number of rooms in houses in that block is greater than 1661, then the median house value for houses in that block is likely to be greater than $200,000.

Otherwise, the median house value for houses in that block is likely to be less than or equal to $200,000. 

This hypothesis suggests that the median income of households is the most critical feature in predicting the median house value for houses in a given block. Housing median age and total number of rooms in houses in a block are also important features, but their impact is lesser than the median income of households.<H>



<H>IF Median Income ($) > 60000 THEN The median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000.
ELSE IF Housing Median Age < 20.5 THEN The median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000.
ELSE The median house value for houses in this block is less than or equal to $200,000.

This means that the most important factor in determining whether the median house value in a block is greater than $200,000 is the median income of the households in that block. If the median income is greater than $60,000, then the median house value is likely to be greater than $200,000. If the median income is less than or equal to $60,000, then the next most important factor is the housing median age. Blocks with a median housing age less than 20.5 years are also likely to have median house values greater than $200,000.<H>



<H>- If median income is greater than $70,000, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000.
- If median income is less than or equal to $70,000, then:
   - If the housing median age is less than or equal to 20 years, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000.
   - If the housing median age is greater than 20 years, then:
      - If the total rooms is greater than 1000, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000.
      - If the total rooms is less than or equal to 1000, then the median house value for houses in this block is less than or equal to $200,000.

This decision tree hypothesis suggests that higher median income is the strongest predictor of higher median house value. However, for blocks with median income less than or equal to $70,000, other features such as housing median age and total rooms may also play a role in predicting median house value.<H>



<H>1. If the median income is greater than $63,000, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000.
2. If the median income is less than or equal to $63,000, then go to Step 2.
3. If the housing median age is less than or equal to 18.5 years, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000.
4. If the housing median age is greater than 18.5 years, then go to Step 3.
5. If the total number of rooms is less than or equal to 4,210.5 and the total number of bedrooms is less than or equal to 1,073.5, then the median house value for houses in this block is greater than $200,000.
6. If the total number of rooms is greater than 4,210.5 or the total number of bedrooms is greater than 1,073.5, then the median house value for houses in this block is less than or equal to $200,000.

This decision tree suggests that the most important factor in determining whether the median house value for houses in a block is greater than $200,000 is the median income of the households in the block. However, if the median income is less than or equal to $63,000, other factors such as the housing median age, total number of rooms, and total number of bedrooms also play a role in determining the median house value.<H>



<H>If the median income of a household in a block is greater than $50,000, then the median house value in that block is likely to be greater than $200,000. If the median income of a household in a block is less than or equal to $50,000, then the age of the housing in that block is also important. If the housing median age is less than or equal to 20, then the median house value in that block is likely to be greater than $200,000. If the housing median age is greater than 20, then the total number of rooms in the houses in that block is important. If the total number of rooms is greater than 5000, then the median house value in that block is likely to be greater than $200,000. If the total number of rooms is less than or equal to 5000, then the median house value in that block is likely to be less than or equal to $200,000.<H>
